      Shahid Dharmabhakta National transplant Center- SDNTC (Human Organ
      Transplant Center- HOTC) is situated at Dudhpati-17, Bhaktapur, a
      beautiful and a serene place at the distance of 12 kilometers from
      Kathmandu. It was established in 2012 by the Ministry of Health to
      strengthen and expand organ transplantation services in the country. The
      outdoor inauguration of the center was facilitated by the then Health
      Minister Rajendra Mahato, while the indoor service was instituted by the
      then Health Secretary Dr. Pravin Mishra. This center started its services
      merely with the out-patient and dialysis services, but within a few years
      of its establishment it has extended its services beyond dialysis and
      organ transplantation. It is under the directorship of Senior transplant
      surgeon Dr. Pukar Chandra Shrestha An estimated figure shows that the
      incidence of kidney failure in Nepal is 3,000. Likewise, 1,000 people
      develop liver failure annually. The estimated diabetic population who
      might be benefitted from pancreas transplantation in Nepal is 30% which is
      10% of total population. Thus, increasing concern towards non-
      communicable diseases and organ failure resulted in the establishment of
      this center.
